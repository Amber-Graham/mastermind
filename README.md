Mastermind

Mastermind game using Ruby OOP principles for The Odin Project.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

This was a very interesting project. I had a very hard 
time trying to figure out the computer algorithm. I know 
I needed to use Knuth's Mastermind algorithm, but couldn't piece
it all together. I'm going to continue to work on it, but for now, 
what I have will do. 

Another frustrating thing I dealt with (although it's minor) is that my
'GAME ON!' title art won't line up properly! EDIT: I got it to work. :)
I was having issues because the '\' character was disappearing. In order
to fix this, I put double backslashes '\\', which 'escapes' it and allows
for it to show up when using 'puts'.  Yay!

I added the gem colorize for this project and it worked beautifully. It was exactly
what I needed and I got the opportunity to sort through other ruby gems that look
amazing! I still have a lot of learning to do, but am happy with the progress
so far. I would really like to build this game out to be a playable game
on the web. Maybe that will happen later in the curriculum! I hope so.

I learned new methods including: .dup, .zip, %w, .sample and tried to reinforce 
OOP principles (although, I think I did better with tic-tac-toe).
